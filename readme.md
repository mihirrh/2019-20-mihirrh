While conducting the user testing, one issue was identified which was to do with the flexbox adding product images, text and buy now button but had issue adding all 3 in one flexbox but issue was fixed


### Issue 2 - Responsive Navbar

Another issue found during the testing was the navigation bar for the website was not responsive and for mobile devices hamburger menu was linking all the pages together which lead to not let it open any of the pages.

## Further Work

My website was using simple google map iframe embedded version ti display map location but then after. I have implemented Google Map API to display current google map for the location and added code in JS.


## Conclusion

The front end web development module has been the most enjoyable module for me. as I have learnt interesting stuff about web technologies and managed to implement those technology into my current website for  assignment. Although error occured during the developement of the project. However, I managed to fix those errors and responsiveness of the website so it could be compatible for other devices such as mobile phones, iPad, Laptop and Desktop so users from other devices can browse easily.

Thanks to my tutors and lecturers for the learning content and even in this COVID-19 situtation with their online classes and help through emails I was able to clear out the confusion I had.

Thanks to Dr Graeme Stuart, Dr. Fania Raczinski, Dr Dave Everitt.
